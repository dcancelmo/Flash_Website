			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am from Rochester, New York and attended high school in the city of Rochester. I have lived within 30 minutes of the city of Rochester for my entire life. Growing up I did martial arts, played golf, soccer, ultimate frisbee, wrestling, baseball, and was involved in music. As a kid I learned how to play piano, trumpet, guitar, and sing, and still do most of these things. I was also involved in musicals throughout middle and high school. Currently at the University I am a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, and outside of that spend the rest of my time completing course work.</p>

			<h2>College Life</h2>
			<p>I am a Political Science major, with a minor in CSC and a cluster in visual arts. My Political Science major has a focus on theoretical political science and the use of models in research. Using this discipline I plan on completing research in the field of voting institutions, outcomes, and logical choice in voting. After graduating I would like to pursue a PHD in Political Science and do research. Following this I would like to work in government and public service in some way, hopefully in Rochester, my hometown. For this, I have taken: Game Theory, International Relations, Positive Political Theory, Political Economy, Comparative Political Parties, and several other courses. For my art cluster, I have taken courses in studio practice and printmaking.</p>

			<h2>Jobs</h2>
			<p>The most noteworthy job Iâ€™ve had was as a canoe tripping guide for Camp Pathfinder, located in Algonquin Park Ontario. Camp Pathfinder acts as a host for kids from ages 7 to 15 looking to go on wilderness excursions. For my job as a guide, I was in charge of organizing, planning, and leading canoe trips for anywhere from two to fifteen days. A canoe trip consists of reaching different lakes each day by paddling and carrying the canoes. We pack all of our food and clothing into communal packs for 9 people at a time. The only thing we do not bring is firewood, which is collected at each campsite. All cooking is done over an open fire, regardless of weather or location. For this job I earned certifications such as: WFR (Wilderness First Responder), ORCKA (White Water Canoeing Certification), and Bronze Cross wilderness water safety.</p>
