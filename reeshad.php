		<h2>Growing Up</h2>

		<p>I was born in Toronto, Canada, but my true heritage comes from Bangladesh. Specifically, my mother and father were born and raised in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Naturally, that is where I would gravitate towards for my early childhood. Around my kindergarten years, we moved to Singapore to learn the culture. When grade school was on the horizon for me, we moved back to Ontario, Canada in hopes of settling down. When my father decided that more education was the right choice for him, we moved to Arkansas where I would live my days in middle school. When high school came around, however, my father found a nice job in Wisconsin and so we lived for a record time of five years before I made the decision to study in Rochester, New York.</p>

		<h2>Courseload</h2>

		<p>At the University of Rochester, I was “lucky” enough to go through the introductory courses needed for medical school. Biology and Chemistry have dominated most of my course load over my last three years here. This year, I am taking more Computational Biology-focused courses such as Applied Genomics and Molecular Biology. I have also undertaken a minor in computer science as a sort of Plan B if medical school does not work out. Because of this, I am also taking Introductory CS (learning Java), Advanced Web Design, and Recreational Graphics. </p>

		<h2>Career Interest</h2>

		<p>During these times of moving, I was adamant on pursing the medical field. Before a life-altering event occurred, I wanted to become an astronaut (or at least something space-related). It was and still is now one of my biggest fascinations on this planet to explore or study other planets. To think that there are infinite possibilities outside of our universe is overwhelming yet exciting. However, after a medical emergency involving my mother shocked me and brought me down to earth, I was determined to never let what me and my mother went through happen to any other person (to the best of my abilities). Since then, I have pursued a line in medicine and am currently on course to medical school following undergraduate graduation.</p>

		<h2>Jobs</h2>

		<p>With any good undergraduate career, jobs must be held to reinforce learning. For my junior summer session, I have had the opportunity to work at an internship at a Michigan hospital as a research assistant. This opportunity taught me many things, mainly about patience and determination. The other jobs that I have held at the University were mostly office jobs at the hospital, but this summer internship has taught me more about core values and, equally as important, the hospital setting and what it was like.</p>
