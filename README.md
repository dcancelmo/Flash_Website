_This readme describes the layout of the San Francisco flash website. This website showcases the profiles of three UR Students: Kaleb Chitaphong, Reeshad Rahman, and Sharfuz Z Shifat. 
**For convenience sake, profiles are arranged in alphabetical order of last name.** 
In addition to the three profiles it also contains an index page, which acts as a welcome page to the website, and links back to all three of the profiles, as well as showcasing the sources for this data on the page._ 

# Ontology
This website is concerned with the profiles of three UR students in the CSC 174 class: the creators of the San Francisco flash website. The breadth of the information on this page is limited to students in the San Francisco team. It describes some personal details of their lives and background, their life in college and their job experience. It also provides a pathway back to the original documents from which these profiles were extracted.

# Taxonomy
The banner with the label "San Francisco website" is considered the ultimate header and so receives an h1, which is then followed by a h2 for the person's name. The subsequent sections, 'About Me, College Life, Jobs and Sources', are h3s, since they are information contained within the bracket of the person in question.

# Choreography
The various sections are presented in somewhat chronological order -- About Me covers biographical aspects such as parents and place of birth, after which we proceed to college. Job experience can be somewhat parallel to college life, but seems to make the most sense coming last. 
**In terms of choice, the navigation arranges the students in alphabetical order of last name, simply for convenience.**

The general format is as follows:

# Banner - San Francisco team
