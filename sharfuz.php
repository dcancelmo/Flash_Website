			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>I am an international student from Bangladesh studying at the University of Rochester, NY. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. My home town is the capital of Bangladesh called Dhaka.</p>

			<h2>College Life</h2>
			<p> As a freshman I was an EcoRep. I loved that position as it allowed me to learn a lot about sustainable living style and also aware my peer mates about recycling and reducing their carbon foot print.I have always been highly interested in Entrepreneurship. When I recognized that there wasnâ€™t a proper entrepreneurial ecosystem at UR, I decided to make one. With my friend I co-founded Meliora LaunchPad, which is the undergraduate entrepreneurship student organization at University of Rochester. I am currently the President of the organization. My two other notable involvement includes being the co-founder of Residence Hall Association (RHA) and also being the current president of Order of Omega.</p>

			<h2>My Jobs</h2>
			<p>I had my first industry experience last summer, where I worked as a software developer for FedEx Services at Pittsburgh, PA. I worked full stack software development where I was able to learn Angular, React, and Java as back end.</p>
