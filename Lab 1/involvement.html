            <p>
                As a freshman I was an EcoRep. I loved that position as it allowed me to learn a lot about sustainable living style and also aware my peer mates about recycling and reducing their carbon foot print.I have always been highly interested in Entrepreneurship. 
                When I recognized that there wasnâ€™t a proper entrepreneurial ecosystem at UR, I decided to make one.
                 With my friend I co-founded Meliora LaunchPad, which is the undergraduate entrepreneurship student organization at University of Rochester. I am currently the President of the organization. My two other notable involvement includes being the co-founder of Residence Hall Association (RHA) and also being the current president of Order of Omega.
