	<h2>Courseload</h2>

	<p>At the University of Rochester, I was “lucky” enough to go through the introductory courses needed for medical school. Biology and Chemistry have dominated most of my course load over my last three years here. This year, I am taking more Computational Biology-focused courses such as Applied Genomics and Molecular Biology. I have also undertaken a minor in computer science as a sort of Plan B if medical school does not work out. Because of this, I am also taking Introductory CS (learning Java), Advanced Web Design, and Recreational Graphics. </p>
