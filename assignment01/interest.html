	<h2>Career Interest</h2>

	<p>During these times of moving, I was adamant on pursing the medical field. Before a life-altering event occurred, I wanted to become an astronaut (or at least something space-related). It was and still is now one of my biggest fascinations on this planet to explore or study other planets. To think that there are infinite possibilities outside of our universe is overwhelming yet exciting. However, after a medical emergency involving my mother shocked me and brought me down to earth, I was determined to never let what me and my mother went through happen to any other person (to the best of my abilities). Since then, I have pursued a line in medicine and am currently on course to medical school following undergraduate graduation.</p>
