	<h2>Growing Up</h2>

	<p>I was born in Toronto, Canada, but my true heritage comes from Bangladesh. Specifically, my mother and father were born and raised in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Naturally, that is where I would gravitate towards for my early childhood. Around my kindergarten years, we moved to Singapore to learn the culture. When grade school was on the horizon for me, we moved back to Ontario, Canada in hopes of settling down. When my father decided that more education was the right choice for him, we moved to Arkansas where I would live my days in middle school. When high school came around, however, my father found a nice job in Wisconsin and so we lived for a record time of five years before I made the decision to study in Rochester, New York.</p>
